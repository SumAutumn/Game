            <strong>Column A - The What:</strong><br>
            I made a website that is kind of a game which means a game which is also an artwork. I made
            a puzzle game that you can enter to next level when you resolve the previous puzzle.
            When you click the game first time, each puzzle scenes will be navigated by a random order.
            Player will have limited attempts for the whole game or you will lose and have to restart the game to
            continue. The beginning is the welcome page to show the introduction of the game and the link of statement page.
            Solving a puzzle correctly can navigate people to the next one.
            <br>
            <strong>Column B - Subject/Theme Starting Point:</strong><br>
            I chose the first definition from this source: https://www.lexico.com/definition/play.
            Play is engaging in (a game or activity) for enjoyment.
            <br>
            <strong>
            Column C - Informing Theory/Logics:<br></strong>
            My idea is based on Anthropy’s theory. From excerpts from Anna Anthropy’s book,
            Rise of the Videogame Zinesters. A game conveys what it's like to experience the subject as a
            system of rules.
            <br>
            <strong>
            Column D - Page-Oriented OR JavaScript-Oriented option (minimum reqs.):<br></strong>
            This game is java-script based. There are 6 pages including index.html, statement.html, word.html, blackjack.html, sudoku.html, final.html
